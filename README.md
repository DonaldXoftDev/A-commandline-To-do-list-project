#To-do-list Program (Command Line)

## Description
This is a simple command line based To do list application using python. it allows users to add new tasks to their list, view those tasks according to their index and being able to remove items.
this project was created as a learning exercise to practice python fundamental concepts, including:

* Data structures(list,dictionaries):
* User input and output
* Conditional Statements
* Loops
* functions

## Features

**Add Task:** Allows users to add new tasks to their to do list.
**View Task: ** Displays the current list of the tasks according to their index.
**Remove Task:** it provides functionality to removet a task from the list by the index

##How to Run
1.make sure you have python installed on your system. You can download it from .....
2.Save the python script (eg. 'todo.py') to a directory on your computer .
3.Open your command line or terminal.
4. Navigate to the directory where you saved the script using the 'cd' command
5. Run the program using the command: 'python todo.py'


## Usage
Once the program is running, you will be presented with a menu of the options you can perfom:
* '1.Add task'
* '2.View task'
* '3.Remove task'

Follow the prompt to interact with your to-do list.

## Learning points
This project helped me solidify my understanding of :
* working with python lists to store and manage data
* working with functions inside dictionary to make coding more efficient'
* implementing flow control using 'if', 'elif', 'else' statements
* Using 'for' and 'while' loops to iterate through the tasks and the menu dictionary
* Basic error handling to handle invalid inputs (e.g for invalid user input)

#Further improvements

**Editing tasks: Allow users to modify existing tasks.
**Graphical user interface (GUI): create a graphical interface using different python libraries like Tkinter or PyQt.
